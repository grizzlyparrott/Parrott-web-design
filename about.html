                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Parrott Web Design was founded with a simple goal: to empower local businesses in Bullhead City and Fort Mohave with websites that don’t just look good, but genuinely help them grow. We believe good design should be accessible without sacrificing quality.</p>

    <!-- Our Story -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>At Parrott Web Design, the goal is simple — create clean, functional websites that help small businesses look professional without breaking the bank. Every project is built with attention to detail, clear communication, and a focus on results.</p>
        <p>What started as one guy experimenting with code turned into a growing passion for design, function, and problem-solving. Whether it’s a single landing page or a full multi-page build, every site is made to load fast, look sharp, and work on any device.</p>
